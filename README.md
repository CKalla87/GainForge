# GainForge

GainForge is a saturation and gain-shaping plugin designed to add weight, grit, and harmonic character to sound. It focuses on controlled drive that can range from subtle warmth to aggressive distortion.

GainForge is an open-source project built for producers and developers who enjoy shaping tone through gain and harmonics.

## Features

- Gain and saturation focused processing
- Smooth harmonic enhancement or aggressive drive
- Designed for drums, synths, and full mixes
- Simple controls with wide creative range
- Lightweight and responsive

GainForge is not about transparency. It is about character.

## Philosophy

GainForge was built around one idea:

Tone is forged under pressure.

Gain can add life or destroy it. GainForge is designed to sit in that space where sound is shaped by force, not polish. It rewards careful control but invites bold moves.

If it feels too clean, push it.  
If it feels out of control, pull it back.
